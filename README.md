# Portfolio
## A personal portfolio using the Hugo site generator

This project will serve as a bit of a portfolio at [buikema.work](http://buikema.work) and grounds for experimentation with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and [Hyde theme](http://themes.gohugo.io/hyde/).

Find [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo) and [Hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde) on GitHub.
