## A Smörgåsbord of Experience

Carpenters, welders, and heavy equipment operators; it seems my family has always built things. Ever since I started developing for the web it has felt like the right balance of designing, engineering, and creativity. Instead of hammers and trowels, it’s HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

Working in a broad range of fields —from [atmospheric research](../post/archives) as an NSF fellow to managing ninety employees within a medium cinema company— has provided the perspective that I rely on to develop websites and tools for the web.

I grew up in West Michigan ([one of the most beautiful parts of the mitt](https://www.flickr.com/photos/drewbuikema/28149708346/in/dateposted-public).) And currently reside outside Ann Arbor, where I’ve lived ever since attending the [University of Michigan](http://lsa.umich.edu).
