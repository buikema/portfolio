Tiffany Leigh Photography is a small studio owned and operated in my home town. Tiffany had previously run all web business through a successful and active Facebook Page. Her website needed to show new customers her work

### Researching the Competition
Problems with photographer run websites from templates.
Balancing flashy photo viewing with practical customer focussed design 

### Squarespace a Solution to Site Update Needs and Responsive Image Requirements
The website would not be updated all the time. Any regular postings to Tiffany's customers would continue to go through Facebook. However, as the business grew, occasionally adding new photo albums would be needed. Enabling Tiffany or others (without HTML experience) to add to the website was important because of little budget for ongoing website maintenance. Squarespace provides a good balance between templating capabilities and still allowing enough individuality from a business's brand. In addition, a photograpphy studio requires that many high quality photos be a part of numerous pages and Squarespace handles responsive images as well as any website service I've encountered.

### Mood Boards / Style Tiles
Creating a brand identity for a small business whose only presence on the web is Facebook provides nearly endlless possiblility. From my prespective, it was important to build an idenity slowly and carefully. The business was likely to change over time and it's easier add on than remove or re-work branding that's no longer appropriate.
