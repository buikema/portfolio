Building a personal portfolio website has been a struggle for me, partly due to time constaints; this is definitely **not** paid time for me. It also requires many decisions about branding design and asthetics that I try not to make when designing for a client. What I mean to say is that I have an easier time divorcing my own preferences from design decisions when I'm working on someone else's project.
